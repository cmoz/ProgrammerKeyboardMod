Welcome to ProgrammerKeys Mod, where Iâ€™ve taken the original ProgrammerKeys repo and supercharged it with AI-powered features, for productivity hacks!
 
 * 1. The code is structured to handle different option sets, allowing users to
 * switch between different configurations and display relevant information
 * on the LCD screen.
 *
 * 2. Modify the `keyboardText` array to change the text sent
 * by each button in the different option sets.
 *
 * 3. Pressing the rotary encoder is used to cycle through the option sets, and the
 * display updates accordingly. Sets are tracked and option set is displayed.
 *
 * 4. The code includes functionality to show a rainbow effect on the LEDs
 * or set all LEDs to a specific color using HSV values.
 *
 * 5. There are variables at the top of the code for you to customize it easily.
